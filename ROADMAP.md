# Roadmap / Task List

## New Features (prioritized)

### High Priority

This seems very promising: <https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/12625#issuecomment-450571483> for running search-replaces on block editor contents as a string

- [ ] Remove line breaks See: #3
- [ ] Remove underlines. See #1
- [ ] Replace all non-breaking spaces with regular spaces. See #2

### Low Priority

- [ ] Convert fake lists to real lists. See #7
- [ ] (Maybe?) Merge consecutive lists into a single list? See #6
- [ ] Consider a find-replace feature? See #4
- [ ] Find-replace all caps to sentence case. See #5

## Cleanup / Tech Debt

- [ ] Significant opportunities to create some shared functions to reduce amount of code
- [ ] Make strings translatable. See #8

## Completed

- [X] ~~Increment and ~~Decrement all heading levels (capped at 2~~ and 6~~)
- [X] Reset all headings to selected level
- [X] Put tools into a new standalone sidebar (plugin?)
- [X] Put each new button/tool into a collapsible panel
