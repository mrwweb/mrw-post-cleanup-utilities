# Roadmap / Task List

## New Features (prioritized)

### High Priority

- [ ] Remove line breaks (can I just do this as a replace on the editor contents rather than block-by-block?)
- [ ] Remove underlines

### Low Priority

- [ ] Convert fake lists to real lists
- [ ] (Maybe?) Merge consecutive lists into a single list?

## Cleanup / Tech Debt

- [ ] Significant opportunities to create some shared functions to reduce amount of code
- [ ] Make strings translatable

## Completed

- [X] ~~Increment and ~~Decrement all heading levels (capped at 2~~ and 6~~)
- [X] Reset all headings to selected level
- [X] Put tools into a new standalone sidebar (plugin?)
- [X] Put each new button/tool into a collapsible panel
